This folder contain code and data necessary to replicate 
"Dynamic conditional eigenvalues" by Hetland, Pedersen and Rahbek (2020).

USBanks.xlsx is the dataset given in log-returns (multiplied b 100)

The file names should be self-explanatory, e.g.
- "main_EigenARCH_application_unrestricted.m" replicates the results from tables 1
 concerning the unrestricted model.
- "main_EigenARCH_application_rank_2.m" replicates the results from tables 2+3 concerning
the model with reduced rank 2.
- "main_EigenARCH_application_rank_1.m" replicates the model with reduced rank 1, 
these results are not reported in the paper.

The folder also contain the two files:
"main_EigenARCH_application_unrestricted_repar.m" and  "main_EigenARCH_application_rank_2_repar.m",
in which the model is reparameterized in such a way, that the unconstrained optimized
can be used. We use this to compute the standard erros of the models. This approach
changes the parameter space to be R, ensuring no issues in finding the numerical derivatives,
which are used to compute the sandwhich formula.

Furthermore, the files "main_EigenARCH_bootstrap_rank_1.m" and "main_EigenARCH_bootstrap_rank_2.m" 
compute the bootstrap critical value for the null hypothesis of a reduced rank.
These use the parameter estimates and restricted residuals from 
"main_EigenARCH_application_rank_1.m" and "main_EigenARCH_application_rank_2.m".

Next, "main_EigenARCH_supLR_res_row1.m" computes the supLR test and associated value
for the hypothesis of a zero row in the matrices A and B. This hypothesis is imposed
on the first row (imposing it on row 2 or 3 does not change the results significantly)

The files "main_top_Lyapunov_rca_rank_2_repar_resampled.m" and 
"main_top_lyapunov_rca_unrestricted_repar_resampled."m compute the top Lyapunov 
coefficient and the associated standard error (based on the numerical delta method)

Finally, "main_SDE_t.m" contains code for estimating the model based on the multivariate
t-distribution. These estimation results are not reported in the paper.
